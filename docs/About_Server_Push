Beside the "Client Pull" Technology, FENT also uses the "Server Push" Technology.
By using "Server Push" Technology, we can make the Real Time Notifications System.

But before using "Server Push", some other tool must be installed. 
They are :
- Redis : use to implement the Publish/Subscribe messaging paradigm.
- phpredis : use for PHP to communicate with Redis server.
- Node.js : use for delivering messages.
- Some node modules include : Socket.io (use for connecting client and node server)
     and node_redis (use for node server to communicate with Redis server)

Then run redis-server at default port (6379)
Run notification_server.js . The socket.io will use port 8080. If you want to change the port, 
change in both notification_server and notification_client file.

If there are problems with the "Server Push", the "Client Pull" is then used instead.
